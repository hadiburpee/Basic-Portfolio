# Basic-Portfolio

This is my basic portfolio.  I had some trouble getting things lined up, and as a result, I likely included too many classes but at this stage, I think it is okay given my current knowledge.

I made a basic webpage with a short bio, a way to contact me and a portfolio where I put covers for music releases (not my own, just for place holding).

I appreciate any feedback.

Thanks,

Hadi
